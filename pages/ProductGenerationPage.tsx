// This component has been deprecated and refactored into specialized pages:
// - ImagePage.tsx (for product, mockup, social, and design modes)
// - CharacterPage.tsx (for character mode)
//
// This was done to improve code organization, reduce complexity, and provide a more
// tailored user experience for each generation task.
